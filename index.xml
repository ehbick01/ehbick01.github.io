      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <title>Knitting to Output w/ Rmarkdown</title>

      <description>Tutorial&amp;rsquo;s purpose Manipulating data and building visuals is the bread and butter of the R language - but what can get lost in the fold is the ability to easily and quickly push analysis out for folks to see. Using knitr and rmarkdown makes that significantly easier, and exists at the press of a button. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;re going to press those buttons.
What are the packages? There are a ton of ways to get information from R out into the world - ranging from static Word or PDF documents all the way to interactive web applications.</description>

      <title>Into the Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://ehbick01.github.io/2017/04/into-the-tidyverse/</link>

      <guid>https://ehbick01.github.io/2017/04/into-the-tidyverse/</guid>
      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s purpose To walk through the tidyverse and become familiar with the functions that it provides the user and how it can make your life so much better to use.
What the heck even is a tidyverse? tidyverse is a collection of R packages providing an all-inclusive resource for data science (well, almost). When you library(tidyverse) the following packages are loaded up as dependencies:
   Package Description     ggplot2 Graphics-building package based on The Grammar of Graphics mapping aesthetics to data visually   tibble Wrapper on traditional dataframes allowing for better printing and viewing data   tidyr Package to easily and quickly get your data into a rectangular format (if not already in one)   readr Super fast package for reading in rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf)   purrr A set of tools for working with functions and vectors for functional programming techniques   dplyr Quickly and efficiently manipulate data with a Grammar of Manipulation (just made that up)    Within each of these there are a handful of other dependencies - not all of which I am going to talk through.</description>

      <description>Background This is a working document to help understand the first stage of this project - the data grab. It is also a helpful learning tool for myself, as this is the first real spider that I&amp;rsquo;ve created to pull data from a website.
Setup The initial setup is quick, simply cd into the directory that you want to work in and run -
scrapy startproject whiskey_reviews  Easy enough.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
