      <description>BackgroundThe purpose of this tutorial is to walk through using d3.js within an Rmd document that is then rendered as an HTML page with a Hugo static site generator. That was probably the most technical sentence of this entire write-up, so let’s all breath a sigh of relief now that we’re through with it.
This is a quick release, so I’m not going to go into much detail about the process to get the data and what it fully represents just yet - I’m saving that for a deeper post with a “tbd” release date at this point.</description>
